His dad wants him to leave the life but Mikio isn't having it. Go down to the beach to find Mikio and choose any choice. A couple of Kansai yakuza show up to beat down. After which, head downtown and near Mahjong Camp to find Mikio's dad again. Beat up the yakuza here and then head down to the Ryudo Office to let Mikio know about his dad's troubles. When you get there, Nakahara will call you. There's problems at Mikio's dad's restaurant, which is Umachi. Head over there and beat up all the guys that showed up, then chase after the Commerce Union President running off. This will close out the substory.",

Approach her and you'll also run into Date's boss, Wakazo. He'll take you inside the cafe and tell you about a case he wrote about six years ago. Basically, he wrote an article implicating a guy named Akechi, but doesn't think he did it. If you agree to help, you'll basically go through the whole case like it's a murder mystery, following the trail of the suspects. Wakazo will also hand you his Notebook, which you can find in the Valuables section of your Items. From there you can see the relationship between all the suspects. The only lead you get from this is that Maeda, the detective in charge, goes to bars at night.\n\nWhich means you can't find him until Chapter 12, the next time you're in Kamurocho at night. When that comes around, head to Bantam and speak to the man in the hat. Ask him about all the topics available. You'll learn some new info, in particular everyone else's whereabouts. Kiryu will also get the idea of checking in with the Florist.\n\nFlorist - Head to his office in Purgatory and get two pieces of data.\nUsami - Go to Mach Bowl and speak to her. You'll learn no one saw Akechi kill Oda.\nAsai - Go to Poppo Nakamichi and you'll learn a woman's name: Saitoh.\nKinoshita - Go to Cafe Alps and speak to him. You'll learn that he saw the murderer leave wearing a cafe uniform, but didn't see his face.\nImagawa - Go to Club SEGA in Theater Square and speak to him. In addition to his info, you'll also learn someone stole his effects on the day of the murder.\nNext, return to Asai and when you choose \"Stop Asking Questions\", Kiryu will bring up Imagawa, and will mention he never stole Imagawa's uniform.\nNow head back to Alps. You'll see Kinoshita talking to a woman named Yuko. Kiryu will also sit down with Wakazo to debrief. Wakazo mentions that the woman is Kinoshita's wife, who was a former employee but wasn't in that day.\nNow you learned Yuko like's host clubs. Go to the only one you know, Stardust. Boom, she's there. Kiryu talks to Yuya about her and Yuko comes up and introduces herself.\nNext head to Bantam to talk to Detective Maeda. He'll pass you a list of evidence. Kiryu gets a eureka moment which we're not privy to.\nLastly, let's go back to Alps. Kiryu will begin the denouement:\nPresent Usami's Testimony\nPresent Ashtray Fingerprints\nPresent Kinoshita's Testimony\nPresent Imagawa's Testimony\nPresent the List of Evidence and Asai's Testimony 2\nJ'accuse Yuko Kinoshita\nPresent Asai's Testimony\nPresent Yuko's Business Card\nPresent Wakazo's Testimony\nPresent the Florist's Testimony\nThe substory will end and you'll get 200,000 yen.",

        "description": "The final substory can only be accessed once you've completed the other 118 substories, all Hitman Missions, and all the training from Minamida. Go to the HLA at Kamuro Castle and speak to Ibuki. He'll mention that Minamida might be linked to the Amon clan of assassins. Kiryu isn't sure, but thinks he should go talk to Minamida. Go to his spot and, long story short, Amon will challenge you once again. He'll give you a destination, so prepare for this. Get yourself the best armor you can get, as many Staminan Sparks as you can fit in your inventory, and make sure you're well prepared ability-wise for this fight. Once you're ready, go to a taxi and choose the Mountainside Coliseum.For Amon's first wave, he'll pull out dual Photon Blades, blades you can't block, and will just perform multiple Kali Stick type moves with them. He's tough to tag like this, but it's barely possible to get a Tiger Drop in while he's doing a normal left-right combo. That causes pretty good damage on him. Also, if ever you heal up and get Heat as well, commit it to an Essence of RollingOnce you knock down two health bars, Amon will pull out a pair of pistols. He becomes very similar to Arase like this, so he has the same weaknesses: smack him from behind when he goes all out. Careful, because the guns knock you back considerably, and while you're down and far away, he'll toss a bunch of exploding cannonballs at youFor his final wave and his last two health bars, he'll add some melee strikes to his gunfighting. If you're close, he'll do rotating kicks similar to Lau Ka Long. It's TIGER DROP TIME. If you're good enough with your Tiger Drop, he should actually be relatively simple to counter when he does these attacksStay healthy, stay smart during the first couple of phases, and this version of Amon will actually be one of the easier instances of him in the series. You get no items directly for this, but you will get the Completion Reward for Substories.",
